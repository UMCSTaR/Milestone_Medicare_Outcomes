# Research Aims

- Aim 1: Determine if **higher Milestone ratings** at completion of general surgery training are associated with better **risk-adjusted patient outcomes** for early-career general surgeons.

- Aim 2: Determine if Milestone ratings at completion of general surgery training can be used to **predict** clinical performance of early-career general surgeons based upon risk-adjusted patient outcomes.

# Research Questions

## RQ1: What is the expected odds ratio of a given risk-adjusted patient complication for each procedure performed on a typical patient by a surgeon within their first *5 years* (18 months?) of practice given a certain *overall (composite) Milestone* rating at time of graduation?

procedure:

- Partial Colectomy

Predictor:

- Overall Milestone Rating (Standardized Mean Score)

complication:

- 30d mortality
- severe complication
- 30d readmission
- 30d reoperation 
- Any complication
- Any complication (exclude death)

## RQ2: 

Predictor: Composite Operative Milestone Rating 
 
procedure and complications are the same as Q1

report name: model_operative_results_tmb.html

## RQ3: 

Predictor: Composite Professionalism Milestone Rating 

procedure and complications are the same as Q1

report name: model_prof_results_tmb.html

## RQ4: highest vs. lowest quartile of Milestone ratings at time of graduation

Not done

### RQ4.1: Ever had less than 7 ratings in any evaluation questions (binary ever_less_7_rating)
